# Bird Call Quiz

## Description
Bird Call Quiz is designed to help users learn common bird species' calls based on regions in the United States. The project utilizes Node.js and React.js and xeno-canto wildlife sounds API to provide an interactive learning experience.

## Installation
To install the project, follow these steps:
1. Download the code from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the `bird-call-quiz` folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm start` to view the React project in the browser.

## Usage

To embark on the bird call learning journey, users first select a region they wish to explore. Once selected, they are welcomed with their first bird call identification.

Each quiz session begins with a notecard adorned with a play button, with a click, the song of a bird species native to the chosen region is heard.

Listeners are then invited to venture a guess, flipping the card to reveal the identity of the unseen songster. A simple choice follows: press the button of victory if correct, or the red button for incorrect. With each decision, the next avian melody will present itself.

Upon completing the set, users are greeted with the end where they learn whether they've beat their previous high score or if there's still room to soar higher. With options to replay the set for mastery or return to the serene sanctuary of the homepage to embark on another adventure, the journey of bird call discovery continues.
